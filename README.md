‚Ä¢	Spot outliers: Identify weird or extreme data points.
‚Ä¢	Detect patterns: Trends over time, seasonality, etc.
‚Ä¢	Check relationships: How two or more variables interact (e.g., price vs rating).
‚Ä¢	Assess data quality: Missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates.
Tools & Techniques:
‚Ä¢	Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
‚Ä¢	Visuals: Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps.
‚Ä¢	Grouping: Aggregation via pivot tables or groupby() (e.g., sales by category).

üîç Insights:
Insights are actionable findings or meaningful conclusions drawn from the EDA. They tell the story behind the numbers.
